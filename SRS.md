### 6. High-Level Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js App Router under `src/app`, server and client components, global styles in `src/app/globals.css`.
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes under `src/app/api/**` handling auth, jobs, matching, career tools, courses, profile, messaging, admin, verification, and uploads.
- **Database**: Mongoose models in `src/models` (`Job`, `JobCategory`, `Course`, `CourseProgress`, `Certificate`).
- **Auth**: `src/lib/authOptions.js` with NextAuth provider configuration.
- **Realtime**: `src/lib/socket.js` and `server.js` for socket server.
- **Media**: `src/lib/cloudinary.js` for uploads.
- **Payments**: `src/app/api/create-payment-intent/route.js` and verification-related endpoints.

- File uploads scanned/validated, stored via Cloudinary with signed URLs.
- Payment data handled only via provider SDKs; no card storage on platform.
- Webhook signatures verified; replay protection.

### 15. AI/ML Requirements

- Explainability: Provide rationale snippets for match scores where feasible.
- Safety: Filter prompts/outputs for harmful content; cap generation token limits.
- Cost control: Enforce rate limits and quota per user/company on AI endpoints.

### 16. Acceptance Criteria (High-Level)
